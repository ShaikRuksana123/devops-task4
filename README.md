 Manage a DevOps project using Git best practices
# DevOps Task 4: Git Project

This is my first DevOps Git project.  
I created this repository to learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub**.

## Steps I followed
1. Created a new GitHub repository.
2. Opened a Codespace to work online.
3. Created files like `README.md` and `.gitignore`.
4. Made commits and learned version control.

## Tools Used
- Git
- GitHub
- VS Code (or GitHub Codespace)

## Outcome
Learned how to:
- Initialize a Git repo
- Create branches and commits
- Push code to GitHub
This change was made in the **dev** branch.
## Git Workflow Summary

- Created branches: main, dev, feature
- Worked on each branch and made commits
- Used Pull Requests to merge into main
- Added tag v1.0
